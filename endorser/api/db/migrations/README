# Endorser database models and migration scripts

Generic single-database configuration with an async dbapi.

## Adding a New Database Model

Add a new python model file in the `endorser/api/db/models` directory.  You can review the existing model files for examples.

To generate new alembic revision (this will go in the `db/migrations` directory), first update the model file(s) and then from the root of the `endorser` directory:

```shell
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "comment"
```

Or, start the docker services (`./manage start --logs`) and then "bash" into the "endorser-api" service and run the above command.

Once your migration file is generated, review the generated code (the autogenerate does not always work perfectly) - you can review the other migrations for examples.
